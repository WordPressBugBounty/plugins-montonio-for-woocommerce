== Description ==

Montonio is a complete checkout solution for online stores that includes all popular payment methods (local banks, card payments, Apple Pay, Google Pay) plus financing and shipping. Montonio offers you everything you need in your online store checkout.
 
= Payments =
The easiest way to collect payments in your online store. Montonio payment initiation service offers integrations with all major banks in Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, additionally Apple Pay, Google Pay, Revolut (available everywhere) and Blik in Poland.
 
All funds are immediately deposited to your bank account and an overview of the transactions can be found in our [partner system](https://partner.montonio.com).

= Card Payments =
Give your customers more ways to pay. In addition to payment links, Montonio lets your users pay by credit card.

= Apple Pay, Google Pay =
Want to offer an even easier way of paying? We also have Apple Pay and Google Pay! You can add these popular mobile wallets to your online store’s checkout. Your customers can pay faster since their credit card info is stored in the digital wallet and they don’t need to enter card details with each purchase.

= Refunds =
You can do a partial or full refund with a couple of clicks in the Montonio Partner System. Just open the order, check what items your customer returned and refund the amount needed.
 
= Financing (Hire purchase) =
Montonio Financing is just the right solution for financing larger purchases. You customers can choose a payment schedule that exactly suits their needs. Shoppers pay in equal instalments but you will get the full payment amount upfront. Plus, there's no service fee for the merchant.
 
= Pay Later =
Give your visitors the most convenient ways to pay – with Montonio 'Pay later' your customers can pay later or split purchase into two or three payments. All this without any additional interest or contract fees for them. Shoppers pay in equal instalments but you will get the full payment amount upfront.
 
= Shipping =
Handle everything from one system: automatically generate, edit and print shipping labels without having to ever leave the Montonio dashboard. Labels are automatically retrieved from providers after order creation. You can start printing with just 2 clicks. With Montonio you can add order tracking codes with a link to the providers’ tracking page.
